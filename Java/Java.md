##Java Notes

**Class**: a blueprint for how a data structure should function

  **Constructor**: instructs the class to set up the initial state of an object
  
  **Object**: instance of a class that stores the state of a class
  
  **Method**: set of instructions that can be called on an object
  
  **Parameter**: values that can be specified when creating an object or calling a method
  
  **Return value**: specifies the data type that a method will return after it runs
  
  **Inheritance**: allows one class to use functionality defined in another class
also One of the object-oriented programming concepts that allows us to reuse and maintain code more efficiently.
